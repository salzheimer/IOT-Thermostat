# MicroPython Thermostat Project Requirements

# MicroPython Version
# Tested with MicroPython v1.22.0 on Raspberry Pi Pico W

# Hardware Libraries (built-in to MicroPython)
# - dht (DHT11/DHT22 sensor driver)
# - machine (Pin, SoftI2C for hardware control)
# - network (WiFi connectivity)
# - ntptime (NTP time synchronization)

# HTTP Client
# - urequests (MicroPython HTTP library for Azure IoT Hub)

# Custom Drivers (included in this project)
# - pico_i2c_lcd (I2C LCD driver for HD44780-compatible displays)
# - lcd_api (LCD API abstraction layer)

# Development Dependencies (for testing on Python 3)
# Uncomment the following for local development/testing:
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0
# ruff>=0.1.0  # Linter and formatter

# Note: MicroPython libraries cannot be installed via pip
# These must be copied directly to the Pico device

# External Library Installation (if needed):
# Some libraries can be installed using upip on the device:
# >>> import upip
# >>> upip.install('micropython-urequests')

# For Azure IoT Hub communication, you need:
# - Valid Azure IoT Hub instance
# - Device registration with SAS token
# - Network connectivity
